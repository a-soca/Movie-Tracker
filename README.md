# Movie Tracker
## Project Brief
Don Robaldson is the CEO of MSR, a company that offers financial services to its
clients. Don is a very busy man, but in his spare time he very much enjoys
watching films and TV shows; there’s just one problem – Don can’t keep track of
which streaming services have which films/shows! So, he’s tasked the software
development team at MSR to develop a system to help him do just that.
